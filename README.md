# **Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python**

This repository contains data science and machine learning projects completed by me for learning and demonstration purposes.



- [Rainfall in Australia](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/Rainfall_in_Australia.ipynb) : In this project, I trained a Logistic Regression binary classifier in Python to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. I have also demonstrated Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation (RFECV), k-fold  Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Optimization using GridSearch CV in this project.


- [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb)


- [Dealing with Imbalanced Classes Problem](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/Dealing_with_imbalanced_classes_problem.ipynb)


- [XGBoost Classification Project](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/XGBoost_Classification_Project.ipynb): **XGBoost** stands for **Extreme Gradient Boosting**. In this project, we will discuss XGBoost and develop a simple baseline XGBoost model. I have demonstrated k-fold Cross Validation and Feature Importance with XGBoost.


- [LightGBM Classification Project](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/LightGBM_Classification_Project.ipynb): LightGBM is a fast, distributed, high performance gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithms. It is used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks. In this project, we will discuss LightGBM model and develop a simple baseline LightGBM model.


- [Stacked Classifier Project](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/Stacked_Classifier_Project.ipynb):
