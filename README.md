# **Data Science Portfolio in Python**

This repository contains data science and machine learning projects completed by me for learning and demonstration purposes.



- [Rainfall in Australia](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/Rainfall_in_Australia.ipynb) : In this project, I trained a Logistic Regression binary classifier in Python to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. I have also demonstrated Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation (RFECV), k-fold  Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Optimization using GridSearch CV in this project.


- [Predict Customer Churn with Python](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/Predict_Customer_Churn_with_Python.ipynb) : Customer churn (also known as customer attrition) is the loss of clients or customers. It is most commonly expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period. In this project, we will build a machine learning model to predict customer churn.


- [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb) : Credit-card fraud is when someone uses our credit card or credit account to make a purchase we didn't authorize. Credit-card companies should take necessary actions to prevent fraudulent credit-card transactions. In this project, we develop an ML model to detect credit-card fraud.


- [Dealing with Imbalanced Classes Problem](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/Dealing_with_imbalanced_classes_problem.ipynb) : In this project, I discuss imbalanced classes problem, which is one of the major problems in machine learning. I discuss random over-sampling and random under-sampling, under-sampling tomek links and cluster-centroids and over-sampling SMOTE in this project.


- [XGBoost Classification Project](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/XGBoost_Classification_Project.ipynb): **XGBoost** stands for **Extreme Gradient Boosting**. In this project, we will discuss XGBoost and develop a simple baseline XGBoost model. I have demonstrated k-fold Cross Validation and Feature Importance with XGBoost.


- [LightGBM Classification Project](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/LightGBM_Classification_Project.ipynb): LightGBM is a fast, distributed, high performance gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithms. It is used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks. In this project, we will discuss LightGBM model and develop a simple baseline LightGBM model.


- [Stacked Classifier Project](https://github.com/pb111/Data-Science-Portfolio-in-Python/blob/master/Stacked_Classifier_Project.ipynb):
